# üö® URGENT: Complete Google Play Store Permission Fix

## The Real Problem Found! üéØ

Your app was still being rejected because **`expo-media-library`** was in your dependencies, which automatically adds `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` and `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` permissions even if you don't use it!

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. **Removed Problematic Package**
- ‚ùå Removed `expo-media-library` from `package.json`
- ‚úÖ This package was automatically adding the forbidden permissions

### 2. **Configured expo-image-picker Properly**
- ‚úÖ Added proper configuration in `app.json` to disable photo permissions
- ‚úÖ Only allows camera permission (which is acceptable)

### 3. **Updated Image Picker Code**
- ‚úÖ All image picker functions now use Android Photo Picker
- ‚úÖ No permission requests for media library access

## üîß **CRITICAL: You Must Do This Now**

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
# Run this command in your project directory:
npm uninstall expo-media-library
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Step 2: Clean Android Build
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Clean Expo Cache
```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

### Step 4: Rebuild Your App
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

## üì± **What's Fixed**

### Before (Causing Rejection):
- ‚ùå `expo-media-library` package was adding `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`/`READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`
- ‚ùå `expo-image-picker` was requesting broad media permissions
- ‚ùå Google Play Store rejected the app

### After (Google Play Compliant):
- ‚úÖ No `expo-media-library` package
- ‚úÖ `expo-image-picker` configured to use Android Photo Picker only
- ‚úÖ Only essential permissions: INTERNET, CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO, VIBRATE
- ‚úÖ All image functionality works exactly the same

## üéØ **Why This Will Work**

1. **No More Hidden Permissions**: `expo-media-library` was the culprit
2. **Android Photo Picker**: Uses system picker without broad permissions
3. **Same Functionality**: Users can still select images for Profile, Trucks, Store, etc.
4. **Google Play Compliant**: Only requests permissions your app actually needs

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Run the cleanup commands above**
2. **Build and test your app**
3. **Submit to Google Play Store**
4. **Should pass review this time!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- The `expo-media-library` package was never used in your code but was adding permissions
- All your image picker functionality will work exactly the same
- Users will get the native Android Photo Picker (better UX)
- No more permission rejections from Google Play Store

## üîç **Verification**

After cleanup, your `AndroidManifest.xml` should only have:
- `INTERNET`
- `RECORD_AUDIO` 
- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
- `VIBRATE`

**NO** `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions.

This fix addresses the root cause of the Google Play Store rejection! üéâ
