# Google Play Store Permission Fix Summary

## Issue
Your app was rejected by Google Play Store because it was requesting `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` and `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` permissions, which Google considers too broad for apps that only need occasional image access.

## Solution Applied
Replaced permission-based image access with Android Photo Picker approach, which doesn't require broad media permissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Problematic Permissions
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **Removed**: 
  - `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
  - `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- **Kept**: Only essential permissions (INTERNET, CAMERA, etc.)

### 2. Updated Image Picker Utilities
- **File**: `Utilities/imageUtils.ts`
  - Removed `checkMediaLibraryPermission()` function
  - Updated `selectImage()` and `selectMultipleImages()` to use Android Photo Picker without permission requests
  - Kept camera permission for `takePhoto()` function

- **File**: `Utilities/utils.ts`
  - Updated `selectManyImages()` to remove permission checks
  - Now uses Android Photo Picker automatically

### 3. Created New Photo Picker Utility
- **File**: `Utilities/photoPickerUtils.ts` (new file)
  - Provides clean photo picker functions without permission requests
  - Includes backward compatibility functions
  - Uses Android Photo Picker on Android 13+ automatically

## How It Works Now

### Before (Problematic)
```typescript
// This requested broad media permissions
const { status } = await ImagePicker.getMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();
if (status !== 'granted') {
  const result = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync();
  // This triggered READ_MEDIA_IMAGES/READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permissions
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
// This uses Android Photo Picker without permissions
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
  mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
  allowsEditing: true,
  aspect: [4, 3],
  quality: 0.8,
  // No permission requests - Android Photo Picker handles it
});
```

## Benefits
1. **Compliant with Google Play Store**: No more permission rejections
2. **Better User Experience**: Users get the native Android Photo Picker
3. **Privacy Friendly**: No broad access to all media files
4. **Backward Compatible**: Works on all Android versions
5. **Same Functionality**: All image picking features still work

## Components Affected
- Profile image upload (`app/Account/Profile.tsx`)
- Truck image upload (`app/Logistics/Trucks/AddTrucks.tsx`, `EditTruck.tsx`)
- Store product images (`app/Transport/Store/CreateProduct.tsx`)
- Load images (`app/Logistics/Loads/AddLoads.tsx`)
- All other image picker components

## Testing
All existing image picker functionality should work exactly the same, but now uses the Android Photo Picker instead of requesting broad media permissions.

## Next Steps
1. Build and test your app
2. Submit to Google Play Store
3. The permission rejection should be resolved

## Technical Notes
- Android Photo Picker is available on Android 13+ (API 33+)
- On older Android versions, it falls back to the standard gallery picker
- Camera functionality still requires camera permission (which is acceptable)
- No changes needed to your existing component code
